### INTRODUCTION:

Online shopping is the process whereby consumers directly buy goods or services from a seller in real-time, without an intermediary service, over the Internet. It is a form of electronic commerce. This project is an attempt to provide the advantages of online shopping to customers of a local shop. 

### OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE OF THE PROJECT:
